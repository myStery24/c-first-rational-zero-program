Algebra Semester 1 2020/2021 Group Assignment

**PART B**
---
Using C, write a program to find the first rational zero of a polynomial 𝑎𝑥^3 + 𝑏𝑥^2 + 𝑐𝑥 + 𝑑. The output should be as shown in Figure Q3. Use the following information for the program:

•	𝑎 is fixed to 1

•	Once the first rational zero is found, the integer will be displayed and program will be stopped.

•	If no rational zero is found, a message "No rational zero found!" will be displayed.

Note: Test your program with at least 3 cubic polynomials and show samples of output in your report.
